# Project Overview

TraderDashboards is a free analysis charting solution using real-time and end of day data for equity traders and investors.  
As a standalone product TraderDashboards can be used in conjunction with an execution platform.
TraderDashboards provides an informational edge that can enhance a traders existing strategy.

## TraderDashboards assists in four real world trading and investing processes:

1. Pre-market multi-timeframe analysis of the major indexes to frame the market and create a bigger picture road map
2. Digging deeper and identifying strong sectors in a strong market and weak sectors in a weak market
3. Analysing specific stocks to potentially trade in line with the the above top down analysis
4. Monitoring live market data: quickly being able to identify intraday sentiment, overall market direction, breaking news and economic events


## User Profiles:

The majority of the below market participants will typically manage individual accounts and be classed as non-professionals with their brokers. 
They will be largely discretional traders trading outright positions.
The strategy styles will include a mix of trend and mean reversion plays across a range of time horizons from intra-day to quarterly and longer.     

- **Investors managing a portfolio** focused on sector ETF's and/or stocks executing via stocks, futures, options or CFD's.
  This participant will use technicals as more of a timing tool but also heavily lean on company fundamentals and have a view on the economic landscape with
  a typical time horizon ranging from months to years.  

- **Swing traders managing a portfolio style trading account** on sector ETF's and/or stocks. This participant will have a typical time horizon from days up to a month
  and will lean on technicals as their primary decision making tool but also confirm their trade ideas with fundamental and economic research.

- **Intra-Day traders** managing a trading account largely holding one positon at a time and ending each trading session flat.  
  This participant rarely holds positions overnight and is active during the US open.  
  This trader can operate within a range of time frames within the day timeframe from scalping 5-10 ticks/cent to targeting intra-day swings of multiple points. 
  These intra-day swings can be either break out trending plays or ranging mean reversion plays.  This trader may execute via futures, CFD's or stocks.

## Stakeholders and their business goals:

## Design
- Color Scheme
    - The main colours within the 3rd party charting widgets is white, green and red and these are not accessible to change.  Therefore the site colour theme is designed
    around these core colours in order to produce a codehesive look and feel across the site. Because the dashboards incorporate many busy features the rest of the site is
    made with a focus towards looking simple, subtle and clean to create a balance.     

- Typography
    - Again depending on which provider is mostly used for the 3rd party widgets the website typography will be set to best match this.

- Images
    - Due to the nature of the website there is not much real-estate for many images however a choice hero image will be used on the home page and potentially a further feature image on the contact page.
      The images need to be in keeping so as to contrast nicely with the existing colour pallete.

Overall with the design, a focus during development is to maintain a clean and subtle look as the website is jam packed with user features that could become too busy very quickly.

## Bugs & Solutions:
- **Bug:** The justify-content-center bootstrap class is not centering the navbar ul
    - [X] **Solution** I ended up setting the navbar float: none and pos relative, 
    then setting the navbar-nav to pos absolute, right 20px.  This worked well leaving the logo to the left and 
    links to the right
- **Bug:** The drop down menu links (background) flash boostrap blue when clicked grrr
    - [X] **Solution** Stackoverflow: .dropdown-item:active did the trick I could then pick any colour in the rainbow
- **Bug:** collapsed menu li nav-items in the drop down menu do not cover the view port width 
    - [X] **Solution** I had altered the styling when floating the ul to the right, After undoing these changes the collapsed menu worked again.
- **Bug:** All of a sudden all the style for all charts on all pages stopped working and was not visible in the dev tools. 
    - [X] **Solution** I had accidentally deleted a closing squiggly bracket when writing comments and this broke the below styles for the class="charts"
- **Bug:** Home page - YouTube iframe overlapping content below, in a big way.
    - [X] **Solution** I ended up using media querries and using large amounts of margin-top for the below content.
    This doesnt feel like it should be the best solution but this has allowed me to manage the overlapping issue instead of
    actually fixing it. The home screen is fully responsive now.
- **Bug:** Home page - the economic calendar iframe is contained within div's but will only scroll on the Y axis even when it is contained within a div with overflow:scroll
    - [] **Solution** Unresolved, but very usable even on mobile.  Date, time and event are all visible.
- **Bug:** README.md links to external url's even with target="_blank still open within the same tab (Have tried both mark down and mark up methods)
    - [] **Solution** Unresolved, all links are now in markup using <a> tags which include target="_blank".  Visitors will for now right click 'open in new tab' Not great but not a show stopper 

**Note:** Being my first project I began the project unknowingly using a mix of methods to position content, it was like putting pieces from two different puzzles together (containers and items). However as I struggled through I slowly began to understand 
more and more how Boostrap rows and columns work in conjunction with Flexbox and how other properties work when used with flexbox for example margin:auto;
This is one of the biggest lessons learnt during the project that I will carry forward.

## Testing  Business Goals & User Stories

### TraderDashboards Owner Goals:
- To get TraderDashboards out and being used by equity traders around the world: 
    - The website is ready to be distributed to market participants
- To build a contact list of potential future customers and provide prospects easy access to contact the owner to discuss their own goals:
    - **Important** By utilising Google Apps Mail in conjunction with leveraging a 3rd party form-submission-handler.js file both the contact and subscribe page forms are fully functional.
    They both provide a success message to the user keeping them on the page to continue on to another page plus all subscribe and email contact details 
    are automatically saved to TraderDashboards Google Drive contact spreadsheet which also captures the values within the radial options.  This is brilliant as the act of 
    creating a database of prospective clients which is also a mailing list is automated.  This has got to be the part of the project that I am most excited about.


![Email submission event](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73107656/101062024-0a07b100-3589-11eb-9173-6d5925f3467a.PNG)


![Subscribe submission event](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73107656/101063520-cc0b8c80-358a-11eb-82ac-e78b57085938.PNG)
- To promote professional trading processes and present market analysis tools in a more functional way:
    - The way the analysis dashboards are presented promotes a logical sequence which naturally assist the user in building a holistic picture of the current market environment.
    This also very much creates consistency in the process, which allows for skill development and the opportunity to become familar with intermarket relationships and when they change 

### Prospective Client Goals:
- Prospects are using the site while at the same time considering if the developers at TraderDashbaords would make a good fit for the project they are planning for their own business: 
    - The website presents to prospects that not only can the developers at TraderDashboards build tools that they would like to build for themselves but also demonstrates
    that the developers also understand their trading and investment business and the industry.  This should build confidence and rapport  

### Potential Employers Goals:
- Employers will want to see professional coding acumen as well as trading and investing knowledge and experience plus a passion for both. A developer that can communicate 
    with other parts of the business and understand how the end product is utilised in the real world will be of value. I feel this comes across in the choice of products used, the way the dashboards 
    are organised and presented and also in the demonstration videos 

### First Time Visitor Goals:
- To understand what the website does and if they are interested within 10 seconds:
    - The hero carousel at the top of the home page includes 3 sliders clearly stating what the website is all about
    - Scrolling down the introduction section is clear with very short text leading to short videos
- To get access to the trading dashboards and see what all fuss is about quickly and with minimal clicks:
    - Every page has a fixed top navbar with a consistent layout across pages.  Users can visit any page from the top nav bar
- To decide if TradeDashboards presents data in a way that provides value to their trading/investing operation and if they should bookmark a given dashboard:
    - Users can either watch the videos or get straight into the dashboards.  They can resize the browser to fit their existing screen set up and even have full functionality on mobile for every dashboard.
- Does TraderDashboards allow the trader to develop the building blocks of their trading edge, do they feel using the tool increases their edge in the market:
    - Yes the way the Index-Dash is presented promotes traders to first identify supply and demand in risk off assets, then risk assets and then on to compare the major indexes to complete the story
    - The Intraday-Dash is presented to provide a real-time snap shot of risk sentiment and overall market direction      

### Returning Visitor Goals:
- To subscribe and be the first to try new trading products as they are rolled out:
    - Visitors can get to the subscibe page with one click from any page. They are automatically added to the mailing list spreadsheet within Google Sheets
- To get in touch with the developer and discuss their own goals:
    - Visitors can get to the contact page with one click from any page.  The owner is notified of new messages via email and the new contact is added to the Google sheets
    spreadsheet 
- To give TraderDashboards an ongoing test to see if they are able to develop a greater trading edge:
    - Users can bookmark any dashboard and go straight to that page anytime and also use multiple dashboards at the same time to create their own terminal.
    
### Frequent User Goals:
- For TraderDashboards to become a core part of a traders daily operational processes:
    - Users that regularly utilise the dashboards will become intricately familiar with how these markets move in relation to each other and develop the ability to chunk the
    information from all the data points on the Intraday-Dash.  Over time this allows the trader/investor to develop a powerful edge to add to their existing strategy 
### Frequent User example of how multiple dashboards can be displayed on one monitor and used at the same time:

    Also advice in using the dev tools to dial in on elements that are not acting as expected to identify the cause and make adjustments.  This really helped when
    customising Bootstrap.
    - My friends in the trading and investing industry for sharing their insights during the planning phase and then giving me frank and honest feedback during development     
    - My fellow trader and investor Ricardo Silva for endorsing TraderDashboards and providing a testimonial

# Deployment

## GitHub Pages
The project is deployed to GitHub Pages:
- Be on the main (README) page of the repo to deploy
- Click on  the settings cog at the end of the repo tabs
- Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section
- Choose the branch to publish and save
- A custom domain can be added here and then linked with the DNS settings within cPanel or domain providers website  

## Forking
To work on 3rd party open source projects we can fork the repo. 
To do this visit the desired repo and hit the fork tab in the top right corner which then
makes a copy to your own GitHub account.

## Local Clone
To copy your own repo to maybe use it in a new project:
First create your new repo, then go to the old repo's (the one to be cloned) main page and hit the
code tabe next to the big green Gitpod tab.  Copy the required url depending on if you want to connect through 
HTTPS or SSH and then head over to Git Bash. Get into the new repo directory, type: git clone and then paste the
url of the soon to be cloned repo and press enter. It is done.
