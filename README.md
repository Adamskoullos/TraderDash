# Project Overview

TraderDash is a free analysis charting solution using real-time and end of day data for equity traders and investors.  
As a standalone product TraderDash can be used in conjunction with an execution platform.
TraderDash provides an informational edge that can enhance a traders existing strategy.

## TraderDash assists in four real world trading and investing processes:

1. Pre-market multi-timeframe analysis of the major indexes to frame the market and create a bigger picture road map
2. Digging deeper and identifying strong sectors in a strong market and weak sectors in a weak market
3. Researching the technicals and fundamentals of specific stocks to potentially trade in line with the the above top down analysis
4. Monitoring live market data: quickly being able to identify intraday sentiment, overall market direction, breaking news and economic events


## User Profiles:

The majority of the below market participants will typically manage individual accounts and be classed as non-professionals with their brokers. 
They will be largely discretional traders trading outright positions.
The strategy styles will include a mix of trend and mean reversion plays across a range of time horizons from intra-day to quarterly and longer.     

- **Investors managing a portfolio** focused on sector ETF's and/or stocks executing via stocks, futures, options or CFD's.
  This participant will use technicals as more of a timing tool but also heavily lean on company fundamentals and have a view on the economic landscape with
  a typical time horizon ranging from months to years.  

- **Swing traders managing a portfolio style trading account** on sector ETF's and/or stocks. This participant will have a typical time horizon from days up to a month
  and will lean on technicals as their primary decision making tool but also confirm their trade ideas with fundamental and economic research.

- **Intra-Day traders** managing a trading account largely holding one positon at a time and ending each trading session flat.  
  This participant rarely holds positions overnight and is active during the US open.  
  This trader can operate within a range of time frames within the day timeframe from scalping 5-10 ticks/cent to targeting intra-day swings of multiple points. 
  These intra-day swings can be either break out trending plays or ranging mean reversion plays.  This trader may execute via futures, CFD's or stocks.

## User Stories

### First Time Visitor Goals:
- To understand what the website does and if I am interested within 10 seconds:
    - To quickly and clearly absorb the hero section of the landing page and to understand that TraderDash is essentially a free charting analysis tool
    - To then read the short introduction text (5 seconds) and understand the main purpose of the tool is to provide an informational edge to their trading
    - To click on the short introduction video and get an overview of each dashboard

- To get access to the trading dashboards and see what all fuss is about quickly and with minimal clicks:
    - Dashboards tab located within the nav bar provides a dropdown menu taking them to the dashboard that most interests them initially
    - The nav bar is present at the top of every page so visitors quickly learn how to go directly from one dashboard to another and also to any other page directly

- To decide if TradeDash presents data in a way that provides value to their trading/investing operation and if they should bookmark a given dashboard:
    - To test the functionality of the charts and undertake technical analysis Tasks
    - To re-size the dashboards to fit their screen set-up and test how they can use multiple dashboards at a time
    - To assess if the way the markets have been grouped and condensed provides a better use of screen real-estate than what they are already doing
    - To identify if the data points are presented in a way that better promotes data chunking and the ability to absorb, interpret and act with confidence, making informed and timely decisions
