# Project Overview

TraderDash is a free analysis charting solution using real-time and end of day data for equity traders and investors.  
As a standalone product TraderDash can be used in conjunction with an execution platform.
TraderDash provides an informational edge that can enhance a traders existing strategy.

## TraderDash assists in four real world trading and investing processes:

1. Pre-market multi-timeframe analysis of the major indexes to frame the market and create a bigger picture road map
2. Digging deeper and identifying strong sectors in a strong market and weak sectors in a weak market
3. Researching the technicals and fundamentals of specific stocks to potentially trade in line with the the above top down analysis
4. Monitoring live market data: quickly being able to identify intraday sentiment, overall market direction, breaking news and economic events


## User Profiles:

The majority of the below market participants will typically manage individual accounts and be classed as non-professionals with their brokers. 
They will be largely discretional traders trading outright positions.
The strategy styles will include a mix of trend and mean reversion plays across a range of time horizons from intra-day to quarterly and longer.     

- **Investors managing a portfolio** focused on sector ETF's and/or stocks executing via stocks, futures, options or CFD's.
  This participant will use technicals as more of a timing tool but also heavily lean on company fundamentals and have a view on the economic landscape with
  a typical time horizon ranging from months to years.  

- **Swing traders managing a portfolio style trading account** on sector ETF's and/or stocks. This participant will have a typical time horizon from days up to a month
  and will lean on technicals as their primary decision making tool but also confirm their trade ideas with fundamental and economic research.

- **Intra-Day traders** managing a trading account largely holding one positon at a time and ending each trading session flat.  
  This participant rarely holds positions overnight and is active during the US open.  
  This trader can operate within a range of time frames within the day timeframe from scalping 5-10 ticks/cent to trageting intra-day swings of multiple points. 
  These intra-day swings can be either break out trending plays or ranging mean reversion plays.  This trader may execute via futures, CFD's or stocks.
