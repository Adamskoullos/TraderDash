# Project Overview

TraderDashboards is a free analysis charting solution using real-time and end of day data for equity traders and investors.  
As a standalone product TraderDashboards can be used in conjunction with an execution platform.
TraderDashboards provides an informational edge that can enhance a traders existing strategy.

## TraderDashboards assists in four real world trading and investing processes:

1. Pre-market multi-timeframe analysis of the major indexes to frame the market and create a bigger picture road map
2. Digging deeper and identifying strong sectors in a strong market and weak sectors in a weak market
3. Researching the technicals and fundamentals of specific stocks to potentially trade in line with the the above top down analysis
4. Monitoring live market data: quickly being able to identify intraday sentiment, overall market direction, breaking news and economic events


## User Profiles:

The majority of the below market participants will typically manage individual accounts and be classed as non-professionals with their brokers. 
They will be largely discretional traders trading outright positions.
The strategy styles will include a mix of trend and mean reversion plays across a range of time horizons from intra-day to quarterly and longer.     

- **Investors managing a portfolio** focused on sector ETF's and/or stocks executing via stocks, futures, options or CFD's.
  This participant will use technicals as more of a timing tool but also heavily lean on company fundamentals and have a view on the economic landscape with
  a typical time horizon ranging from months to years.  

- **Swing traders managing a portfolio style trading account** on sector ETF's and/or stocks. This participant will have a typical time horizon from days up to a month
  and will lean on technicals as their primary decision making tool but also confirm their trade ideas with fundamental and economic research.

- **Intra-Day traders** managing a trading account largely holding one positon at a time and ending each trading session flat.  
  This participant rarely holds positions overnight and is active during the US open.  
  This trader can operate within a range of time frames within the day timeframe from scalping 5-10 ticks/cent to targeting intra-day swings of multiple points. 
  These intra-day swings can be either break out trending plays or ranging mean reversion plays.  This trader may execute via futures, CFD's or stocks.

## Design
- Color Scheme
    - The colour scheme is a work in motion because in order to maintain a 3-4 colour pallete I will need to work with the limiting factors of using 3rd party features.
      Because the 3rd party features are being sourced through three different providers the challenge is to present them all as one, in a clean and uniformed design.
      The final design may have a dark or light theme and the goal is to have two main contrasting colours using 2 futher main accent colours.  

- Typography
    - Again depending on which provider is mostly used for the 3rd party widgets the website typography will be set to best match this.

- Images
    - Due to the nature of the website there is not much real-estate for many images however a choice hero image will be used on the home page and potentially a further feature image on the contact page.
      The images need to be in keeping so as to contrast nicely with the existing colour pallete.

Overall with the design, a focus during development is to maintain a clean and subtle look as the website is jam packed with user features that could become too busy very quickly.

## Bugs & Solutions:
- **Bug:** The justify-content-center bootstrap class is not centering the navbar ul
    - [X] **Solution** I ended up setting the navbar float: none and pos relative, 
    then setting the navbar-nav to pos absolute, right 20px.  This worked well leaving the logo to the left and 
    links to the right
- **Bug:** The drop down menu links (background) flash boostrap blue when clicked grrr
    - [X] **Solution** Stackoverflow: .dropdown-item:active did the trick I could then pick any colour in the rainbow
- **Bug:** collapsed menu li nav-items in the drop down menu do not cover the view port width 
    - [X] **Solution** I had altered the styling when floating the ul to the right, After undoing these changes the collapsed menu worked again.
- **Bug:** All of a sudden all the style for all charts on all pages stopped working and was not visible in the dev tools. 
    - [X] **Solution** I had accidentally deleted a closing squiggly bracket when writing comments and this broke the below styles for the class="charts"
- **Bug:** Home page - YouTube iframe overlapping content below, in a big way.
    - [X] **Solution** I ended up using media querries and using large amounts of margin-top for the below content.
    This doesnt feel like it should be the best solution but this has allowed me to manage the overlapping issue instead of
    actually fixing it. The home screen is fully responsive now.
**Bug:** Home page - the economic calendar iframe is contained within div's but will only scroll on the Y axis even when it is contained within a div with overflow:scroll
    - [] **Solution** 
- **Bug:** README.md links to external url's even with target="_blank still open within the same tab (Have tried both mark down and mark up methods)
    - [] **Solution** 

**Note:** Being my first project I began the project unknowingly using a mix of methods to position content, it was like putting pieces from two different puzzles together. However as I struggled through I slowly began to understand 
more and more how Boostrap rows and columns work in conjunction with Flexbox and how other properties work when used with flexbox for example margin:.
This is one of the biggest lessons learnt during the project that I will carry forward.

        https://blog.h-educate.com/how-to-send-an-email-in-a-static-html-page-using-google-sheets-scripts/
        The code used is from the JS file and the relevant classes used in the HTML file 
        This process was orignally put together in this repo: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-to-send-email-via-google-script-html-no-server/blob/master/README.md 

- Content:
    - All content was written by the developer
    
- Media:
    - Images are sourced from ShutterStock and edited by the developer 
    - Icons are sourced from FontAwesome
    - Videos are created by the developer
    - The charting widgets and stock tickers are supplied by TradingView which includes price data from FXCM, CBOE, Oanda and CurrencyCom 
    - The economic calendar and news feed are supplied by Dukascopy who pull data in from many news sources 

- Acknowledgments:
    - My Mentor **Antonio Rodriquez** for keeping me on the straight and narrow and focused on the highest priority tasks at different stages of the project.
    Also advice in using the dev tools to dial in on elements that are not acting as expected to identify the cause and make adjustments.  This really helped when
    customising Bootstrap.
